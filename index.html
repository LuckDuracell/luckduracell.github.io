    <h2> Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Flour (never let it face you directly)</li>
      <li> Salt (take it by surprise)</li>
      <li> White Granulated Sugar (watch out for a rear kick)</li>
      <li> Lemons (don't let it's colorfulness distract you)</li>
      <li> Milk (by VERY weary of the horn, don't make the same mistake you did with the rhino)</li>
      <li> Eggs (do not underestimate it's magical weight, they way hundreds of millions of pounds)</li>
      <li> Butter (the pink ones are more deadly)</li>
      <li> Vanilla Extract (their hooves won't cut, they act more as a bludgening tool)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Method: </h2>
    <ol>
      <li> Put some flour in a bowl with a pinch of salt </li>
      <li> Whisk in the eggs, milk, and flour until super smooth </li>
      <li> Put like just a TINY splash of vanilla extract</li>
      <li> (Optional) Chill mix for 30 minutes </li>
      <li> Grese pan and heat to medium </li>
      <li> Pour 60ml of batter and make super thin</li>
      <li> Cook for like 2 minutes</li>
      <li> Take crepe, squeeze lemon juice all over it, and put quite a bit of sugar on it</li>
      <li> And remember, never take on a unicorn unprepared</li>
    </ol>
